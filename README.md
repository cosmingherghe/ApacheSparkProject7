# File streaming

- A short and sweet example of how you can use streaming using a file directory.
 
### 

The program is connected to a directory listening for files to come in and as soon as a file comes in it would process that file.
Can also be set up with Amazon S3 bucket as more files come into that bucket it would process those files on an incremental basis.
